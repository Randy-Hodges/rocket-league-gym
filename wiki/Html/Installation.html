      <h2> Installation </h2>
      <p>
      Alright future me who needs a reference on how to reinstall this stuff on a new computer, here it is:
      <br><br>
      The most basic way to install rlgym is through the command line and by using<code> pip install rlgym</code> . <br><br>If you are like me, you would be installing this in a virtual environment through anaconda. Make sure you have anaconda, then create a new virtual environment and through the anaconda command prompt (Hit windows then type "anaconda prompt" to get there) change to your current environment to your virtual environment through the command <code>conda activate [name of your environment]</code> If, for example, I had called my new environment 'tf', my command would be <code>conda activate tf</code>. You should see that your environment has changed (I think there's a difference somewhere on the left side of the command prompt). From there, install rlgym using <code> pip install rlgym</code>
      <br><br>
      If you need to upgrade RLgym, use the command <code> pip install --upgrade rlgym</code> (while making sure you are in the correct virtual environment)
      <br><br>
      </p>
      <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
      <p>If for some reason everything seems like it should work but the game isn't changing when you run code, make sure that your injector didn't magically disappear (hey it happened to me once). You can check by going into the folder RLgym>plugins>RLGym.dll. If it isn't there, clone it from github [insert github link] and put it back. 

      <br><br> Maybe there is more to be done here but hey this is for me now and these are the issues I've had in the past.
