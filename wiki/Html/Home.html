      <h1>Welcome to RLgym</h1>
      <p>Alright well apparently this isnt going to be used for the main wiki, So I guess I’ll just use it for myself. <br><br> RLgym is an api that aims to mimic OpenAI gym for Machine learning purposes. The goal is to create a bot to learn how to play Rocket League through modern learning approaches. RLgym rapidly speeds up training and facilitates all elements needed to support the training of a bot, especially by including an environment, observation, action space, and reward function. RLgym connects to Rocket League through bakkesmod, a modifier to Rocket League.</p>

        Why do we use it?
        It is currently the best way to train a bot for rocket league. Period, no further questions. The framework has been built to streamline the process of training and the changes that a creator has to make has been simplified.
